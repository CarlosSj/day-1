    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
    <p>  I woke up and I went with my brothers to their school just so they can eat some breakfast. Coming home I watched some videos on YouTube to pass time and then headed to the train station while my mom said she was going to do some shopping. <br> The N train didn't take too long to get here so I thought that was all right. But yesterday, instead of taking 30 minutes it took almost a full hour. That was pretty annoying. </p>
