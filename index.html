		    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
		    <p>  I woke up and I went with my brothers to their school just so they can eat some breakfast. Coming home I watched some videos on YouTube to pass time and then headed to the train station while my mom said she was going to do some shopping. <br> The N train didn't take too long to get here so I thought that was all right. But yesterday, instead of taking 30 minutes it took almost a full hour. That was pretty annoying.

			<p>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p>
			<p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.</p>

			<p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>

			<p>Just make little strokes like that. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>
