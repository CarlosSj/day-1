		    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
		    <p>  I woke up and I went with my brothers to their school just so they can eat some breakfast. Coming home I watched some videos on YouTube to pass time and then headed to the train station while my mom said she was going to do some shopping. <br> The N train didn't take too long to get here so I thought that was all right. But yesterday, instead of taking 30 minutes it took almost a full hour. That was pretty annoying.

			<p>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p>
			<p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.</p>

			<p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>

			<p>Just make little strokes like that. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>

			<h2>FINE WORDS FROM A GOD
			</h2>
			<p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>

<p>There are no limits in this world. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>

<p>With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>

<p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We'll have a super time. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Working it up and down, back and forth. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let your imagination be your guide. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>

<p>Let your imagination be your guide. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Let's get crazy. A happy cloud. We'll do another happy little painting. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>We have a fantastic little sky! All kinds of happy little splashes. That's crazy. Isn't that fantastic? Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>
